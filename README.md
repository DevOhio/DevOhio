### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer trying to help those new to coding in Python, C#, or C++.

Sometimes coding is not intuitive when trying a new functionality such as pandas, HTTP requests, connecting to different databases, etc. Hopefully these templates will provide more tangible examples to get you started!
